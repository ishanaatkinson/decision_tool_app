# decision_tool_app
The objective of the decision tool is to support policy-makers, programme managers and other decision makers across Sub-Saharan Africa to decide whether, where, when, how and at what cost to implement perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) in infants.  

Back-end:
The app will incorporate the following in the back-end infrastructure
- Agent based, age stratified dynamic P.falciparum transmission model
- Effectiveness of PMC with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine
- Effective coverage of co-delivered vaccinations
- Genotype-specific protective efficacy
- SP resistance maps
- Implementation costs from our Economic Evaluation team
- Cost savings from averted cases
- Drivers of spatial variation in cost-effectiveness
- Demography of each upper-administrative unit disaggregated by rural/urban areas
- Other intervention strategies implemented (IRS, ITNs, treatment)
- Site-specific seasonality fourier constants
- Distribution channels for PMC-SP administration

Front-end:
- Cases averted
- Deaths averted
- % reduction in clinical and hospitalised cases
- Cost savings
- Incremental costs per disability-adjusted life year averted
- Decision reccomendations (prioritisation economic analysis based on site-specific cost effectiveness thresholds)
- Format: country maps, graphs, tables, auto-generated text
